# CX11 Synth

My Reaper Install: `/Applications/REAPER.app/Contents/MacOS/REAPER`

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

The first run will take the most time because the dependencies (CPM, JUCE, and googletest) need to be downloaded.

Alternatively, you can use bundled CMake presets:

```bash
$ cmake --preset default # uses the Ninja build system
$ cmake --build build
$ ctest --preset default
```

Existing presets are `default`, `release`, and `Xcode`.

To run clang-format on every commit, in the main directory execute

```bash
pre-commit install
```

(for this you may need to install `pre-commit` with `pip`: `pip install pre-commit`).

Don't forget to change "YourPluginName" to, well, your plugin name everywhere ðŸ˜‰

## How was this template built?

This cmake template was taken by the WolfSound template.
